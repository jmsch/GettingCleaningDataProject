# GettingCleaningDataProject

This script creates a small dataset from data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone during an experiment, as required for the Coursera course, Getting and Cleaning Data.

To create the dataset "small_tidy.txt", simply unpack the data in a folder, place the script alongside and adapt the first line of the script (setwd) to reflect your own working directory. Then source or run the script.
